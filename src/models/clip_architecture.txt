CLIP Pipeline

1. Architecture
CLIP model to map images and text into a shared embedding space. Using cosine similarity for thresholding. 

2. Strategy
- Stage 1: Fine-tune CLIP on our training data (Image + Description) to align it with specific class features.
- Stage 2: Fine-tune on rotated data with a lower learning rate. This teaches the model that rotated views are still valid.
- Inference: Compute cosine similarity between the test image and the text embeddings of our 87 known classes (with thresholding).
